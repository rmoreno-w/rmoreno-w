My name is Rodrigo Moreno and I'm from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've recently started to work with tech and I'm loving it, there is so much to learn in so little time! I feel a little overwhelmed with so much to learn and yet at the same time so inspired! I plan to upload some of my personal projects here, so keep an eye! News to come 👀

In my free time I used to play LoL but I'm kind of retired, I just watch streams and some tournaments. Also I like music A LOT and like to discover new songs every now and then. Also, I have a dream (and somewhat of a goal) to live in Sweden in the near future, so in my spare time I'm also learning some Swedish 🇸🇪 Last but not least, I like to have a beer once in a while 🍺

Would you like to get in contact with me?
